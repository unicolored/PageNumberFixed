# PageNumberFixed 0.1.0
Automatically create page numbering in your Indesign documents that will be outlines in order to be fixed, so you can move pages around and still have their older number.

Actually, it works best with A4 format. Needs lots of customization.
Tested on Indesign CC 2014 10.
# How to use

2. Select the paragraph style you want for the new page numbering.
3. A new color will be created "PNFYELLOW"
4. Execute the script and be cool !
